A repository for projects and plans of CSCE 3444

1. Project Title: The union hub

2. Project description:
   This project seeks to address these problems by creating an all-in-one app tailored to UNT students’ everyday lives. This application will be called the UNT student hub.      It will consist of different modules and features that will be working together to provide the user with a good experience. It ￼mainly focuses￼ on three big needs: 

     i. Roommate Finder – helps students connect with roommates who match their habits and lifestyle.
     ii. Lost & found – a space where students can post or find lost items on campus.
     iii. Marketplace – a safe and trusted place for students to buy and sell items within the UNT community.

3. Technologies to be Used: CSS/Html, javascript, react, node.js
